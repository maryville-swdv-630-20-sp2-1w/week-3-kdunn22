1) Parent: Spell
   Child: Accio, Confundo

2) Base: Spell
   SubClass: Accio, Confundo

3) spell.execute will make 'Accio' print
   study_spell(spell) will print the __str__ from the spell object which would be "Summoning Charm Accio"
   study_spell(Confundo()) will create a Confundo object which will print the __str__ from the spell object with the objects description:(answer on next 2 lines)
	"Confundus Charm Confundo
	Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled."
  
4) The get_description method that is called and run here is the Confundo classes get_description method because the get_description from the spell class is overridden in the Confundo class.

5) The following method needs to be added to the Accio class:

def get_description(self):
     return 'This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance'
